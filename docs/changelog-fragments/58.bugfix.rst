Fixed sftp file get issue. On py2
The file ``write()`` method returns ``None`` on py2
if bytes are written to file successfully, whereas
on py3 it returns total number of bytes written
to file. Added a fix to check for the number of
bytes written only in the case when ``write()``
does not return ``None`` -- by :user:`ganeshrn`
