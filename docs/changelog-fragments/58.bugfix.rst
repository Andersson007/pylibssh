Fixed sftp file get issue on py2
The file ``write()`` method returns None on py2
is bytes are written to file successfully, whereas
on py3 it returns total number of bytes written
to file. Add fix to check for the number of
bytes written only in the case when ``write()``
is not returning ``None`` -- by :user:`ganeshrn`
